"[Dragons] can lose their lives in libraries. They ought to be warned.”

[sup]Eris, last survivor in a band of powerful librarians, has devoted her life to the quest of restoring the ancient and mysterious library in the heart of Hewn City. Working with Kyorinrin and other scholarly Beastclans, they try to locate the magical tomes that have been scattered across the region before Scroll Stealers can use them to become 'shadelings'- dangerous and vicious monsters that can (and have) torn imperials to shreds.

It was during a battle with one of these monsters, Eris injured and trapped in one of the petrified trees, that she met Maeniel. An alliance was formed between them and Maeniel departed, returning with a clan that quickly began to grow. As the clan's numbers increased and progress was made upon restoring and recovering artifacts and structures, much of Eris's training and knowledge resurfaced earning her the titles of Curator and Chief Librarian. With the clan's cooperation, she can direct others more suited to the different tasks while focusing on piecing together the clues and knowledge they find. [/sup][/color][/font][/columns]
